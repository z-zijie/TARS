# **TARS**
TARS (Task Automation and Resource Scheduler)


## **Overview**

TARS is a powerful testing framework designed for efficient operator performance and accuracy validation. It automates complex testing workflows, ensuring maximum utilization of CPU and NPU resources through asynchronous task scheduling and dependency management.

The framework is inspired by the automation capabilities of advanced AI systems, combining high performance with ease of use. It is modular, extensible, and built to support large-scale operator testing with minimal overhead.

---

## **Features**

- **Task Automation**: Fully automated workflow management for operator testing.
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient CPU and NPU resource allocation to maximize throughput.
- **Parallel Execution**: Asynchronous task handling to eliminate bottlenecks.
- **Accuracy Validation**: Precise output comparison using golden benchmarks.
- **Modular Architecture**: Decoupled business logic and framework, enabling easy extension.
- **Open Source Friendly**: Licensed under **GPL v3**, ensuring code transparency and freedom.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

Before using TARS, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- **Python 3.8+**
- Required libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `concurrent.futures`
  - `multiprocessing`

### **Installation**

Clone the repository to your local environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TARS.git
cd TARS
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Usage**

#### **Basic Workflow**

1. Prepare your test configurations in a CSV file.
2. Register your custom testing logic using decorators.
3. Run the scheduler to execute tasks.

#### **Example**

```python
from tars import Scheduler, register

@register("example_task")
def example_task(data):
    return data * 2

if __name__ == "__main__":
    scheduler = Scheduler()
    scheduler.add_stage("example_task")
    scheduler.submit_task("example_task", 5)
    scheduler.run()
```

#### **Running the Framework**

```bash
python main.py --config tasks.csv
```
